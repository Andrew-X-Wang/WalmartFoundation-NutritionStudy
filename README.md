# WalmartFoundation-NutritionStudy
A website that is the testing platform for a nutrition study in collaboration with the Walmart Foundation, Duke University and Tufts School of Nutrition aimed at gamifying the online shopping experience to encourage healthier food choices, slated for an experiment with over 1000 participants in the Spring of 2021. 

The experiment utilizes a similar health score system to "Guiding Stars" to rate how healthy a shopper's current selection is.

The website will replicate a fully-functional online shopping experience, with added experimental conditions to explore methods to nudge users towards healthier options.
Current experimental conditions include:
1. A live leaderboard showcasing how the shopper's current cart's health score compares to other users with the same number of items.
2. A set budget for each shopper, with a clear visual display of their remaining budget.
3. A set time limit for each shopper, with a clear visual display of their remaining shopping time.
